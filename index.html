        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Undeclared</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My full name is Junseung Yi, but I go by Eddy. I am from Seoul, South Korea and I moved to California when I was seven years old. I didn’t know any english, but I’ve gotten better over the years living in the U.S. The environment in school and the culture was very different from what I was used to because we never called our parents by their names and wore shoes in the house. I went to elementary school, middle school, and highschool in California. I play golf on the UC Riverside Golf team. The only reason why I started playing golf was to go to college and do what I want to do from there. I fell in love with golf and now my goal has changed to becoming a Professional golfer and play on the PGA tour. I have three sisters that are all older than me but people say wow that sucks, but I really like having sisters because they care about me and having a sister that played professional golf in her career is a big bonus to me. I get to meet the best players in the world and play against them for fun or even go watch them in my free time. 
Right now, I am undeclared and going towards Media and culture studies. I am taking general eds and some MCS classes to fill up my criteria. 
	I started playing golf when I started high school and it was really hard to contact the coaches because I didn't have any resume for the coach, so I played a tournament every week and got up to top 5 in the points to move on to the next level. From there I got top 5 and let my name out there. I finished top 10 in my last tournament to commit to UCR. I was the first freshman to start the tournament and I didn’t play that bad. College golf was harder than I thought, it was playing against the best players all around the world trying to fight for the top spot. I learned a lot from my freshman year and start of my sophomore year. I believe there is more to come. 
	I have only two job experience because I played golf my whole life and I didn’t have any time to work. Golf consists a lot of dedication because you have to put your own time in to become better and it takes a lot of time. I usually practice all day in my off season but now going to college I have barely 3-5 hours if I don’t have class in the afternoon. College has really changed my daily routine when I was in high school because there was more work and studying to do. I didn’t like school because it took my time playing golf away because all I did was study and I didn’t have to practice, but it for a good cause. School is my plan B when my golf career doesn’t help out.
